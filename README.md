DESCRIPTION:

Having recently completed the "INTRODUCTION TO WEB DEVELOPMENT" course sponsored by IBM and delivered on Coursera, I embarked on a practice project to create a simple interest calculator. To do this,I created
three files (index.html, style.css, & script.js)

![Simple Interest Calculator](https://github.com/getacupoftea/project-simple_interest_calculator/assets/125554239/0d9c8d9b-5e21-4806-ac97-03b593549bef)

TECHNOLOGIES/LANGUAGES USED:

HTML, CSS,& JavaScript

CONTRIBUTIONS:

I welcome any contributions to this project and encourage you to reach out with alternative approaches. Check the "Contact" section for details.

CONTACT:

Feel free to contact me via email at tezebada@gmail.com or on Twitter at @getacupoftea for questions or feedback.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

Please understand that this is not a tutorial or guide but rather a practice project. There might be errors as I am still learning. Despite the challenges, it was a rewarding experience. Special thanks to my tech friend(s) for their encouragement and assistance.
